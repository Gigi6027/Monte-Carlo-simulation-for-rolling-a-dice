# Monte-Carlo-simulation-for-rolling-a-dice


To use Monte Carlo simulation to verify the computed probability:

EXAMPLE TAKEN: Probability of getting a odd number when a single fair dice is rolled.

Theoretical value :There are 3 odd numbers (1,3,5) out of the total six values in the die. Therefore the probability is 3/6=0.5.

Inference: The larger the number of trials the closer the experimental value to the theoretical value .In my simulation I have taken the number of trials as 100000.
